 <h1 align="center">⚔️ Markdown Dungeon ⚔️</h1>

> A dungeon is a room or cell in which prisoners are held, especially underground.

This is an example repo illustration of a dungeon using **Markdown** on Github.
In the dungeon the reader chooses which option to take and jumps into an appropriate page of the room that based on their choice.
It is collaborative because the room is written by many authors.

<details><summary>👩‍💻<h2>Contribution Guidelines</h2></summary>
 
1.  <strong>Make Adequately Sized Changes</strong>
    - Keep changes small
    - Don't add an option without adding any gate for readers who decide on that option, so the dungeon will not be full of deadlinks. Instead, the last markdown file the reader reaches on any path of the room should not have any options.
    - <details><summary>Here are some examples of appropriate changes:</summary>

       - Add one or two sentences to an existing "page" (file) in the room.
       - Add a new option to an existing choice point, and link that option to an existing "room" or "floor".
       - Add a new option to an existing choice point, create a new "page" for that option, and add a sentence or two to the new "page".
       - Add a couple of options to a current dead-end "page", and add a "page" or link to an existing "page" for each option.
