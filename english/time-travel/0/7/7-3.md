**You get lucky and stumble into a tasty-looking berry bush 🍇**

You continue through the lush forest, munching on your tasty treats.  
Unfortunately, you're not the only one in the forest who's looking for a meal...
A rabid wolf 🐺 smells your berries and attacks.

You slowly and painfully bleed out until you die 🩸☠️
