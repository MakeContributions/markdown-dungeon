**You take off after the bunny-rabbit 🐰 with the speed of Usain Bolt 🇯🇲, randomly darting through the trees after your prey.**

*On your pursuit, a rabid wolf 🐺 joins in the hunt! Unwilling to share your next meal, you abandon your chase by attacking the beast instead!***

You manage to fight off the rabid wolf, but you've been bitten and are badly bleeding. Within hours, rabies sets in - driving you mad. Alone, hungry and confused deep inside the forest, you think of the time machine and your friends back in the future.You eventually succumb to your injurues, and die ☠️.
