**The back room's contents include three beds, dirty and unmade.**

 There is a second fireplace 🔥, and this one has warm coals .

 Clothes are piled everywhere, both men's 👔 and women's 👚, and an upright wardrobe actually holds reasonably clean, respectable clothes.

 There is a machete 🔪 by the bedside table.
