**You open some books 📖 and read.**

You first pick up a copy of *Monstres And Their Kynde* 📘written in archaic English. You skim to learn it's about wolves 🐺 and werewolves. It piques your interest, inviting you to explore the other titles. 

Returning the tattered chunk to the table, your eye catches **bold** lettering engraved on sheepskin:
 *Les Lupus Horrifique* 📗 by a Dr. Raphael Peltonne 👨‍⚕️. The book is filled with terrifying events concerning a mass outbreak of lupus 🐺 and rabies - told in an excecdingly cynical way.
