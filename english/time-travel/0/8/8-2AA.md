**You wind your way uphill until you reach an ramshackle farm 🏚️🌾.**

Just beyond the boulders you spy the remains of a mostly-collapsed barn. Next to it lies what appears to be a woodshed. As you near your approach, to your delight and releif, a small farmhouse 🏚️ with well-kept fields 🌾 morph into view.
