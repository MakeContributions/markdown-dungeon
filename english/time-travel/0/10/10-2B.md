**You are feeling sleepy 💤.**

You lie in bed 🛌 and drift off to an uncomfortable sleep.

At midnight 🌙, the door 🚪 creaks open. You are wrenched from your nightmares by the feeling of an icecicle piercing your heart 💔.

As your vision fades to black you make out the silhouettes of two werewolves in the moonlight 🐺🐺 crouched by your bedside.

As your final breath escapes you hear their shrill voices ringing in your ears: 
*"For our father..."*

You died ☠️.
