**You cut the bushes 🌳.**

It turns out that this path leads to the river on which you walked earlier!

This is a place where the river is shallow so there will be no problem with crossing.

Soon, you are in your shelter ⛺. You feel terible about what you did. Her screams and blood gonna haunt you in your nightmares ☹️.
