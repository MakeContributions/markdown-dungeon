**So you've decided to stay. This could be a bad idea but you'll be as safe as possible. ⚠️**

You check your pockets and find you have the following items: 📱 Phone, 🔑 Keys, :coin::dollar: Money, 🎒 Bookbag with a laptop and textbooks.

The van must have something useful inside of it. 🤷‍♀️ 🤷‍♂️

Will you explore the van or decide to go home and watch a documentary instead?
