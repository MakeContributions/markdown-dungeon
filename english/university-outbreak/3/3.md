# **You make your way to the pub**

As you near the pub, some of the zombies see you and sprint after you. As you get close to the door, it opens up.
You get inside as someone slams the door shut, putting a metal bar through the door to stop it opening.
Suddenly, you're surrounded by a small group, all looking either scared or weary.
Thankful to have made it in, all you're greeted with is "Are you bit? ARE YOU BIT?!"

TO BE CONTINUED

Thank you for playing! Feel free to add to the story in any way you like, make changes, etc.
