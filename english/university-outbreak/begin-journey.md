It's another 9AM lecture, after spending the whole night before studying. You somehow manage to get to the lecture theatre on time, but are struggling to keep your eyes open.

As a long list of math formulas fill the projected screen, you can't take it anymore. You put your headphones on and doze off. 

As you awake after what feels like hours, you notice you are the only one left in the room, with everyone elses bags being left behind, like they left in a hurry. 

What happened here?
