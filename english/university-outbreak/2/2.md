# **You leave through the top door**

As you go through the door, people outside catch your attention. They're stumbling about a bit, but at least there's others still around!
You see a door in front of you with a cleaning trolley propped against it, as you hear something knocking stuff over through the door.
Alternatively, the stairs to your right look somewhat safe.

What do you do?
