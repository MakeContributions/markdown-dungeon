# **You remove the trolley**

As you remove the trolley, it knocks away a bag that you didn't notice at the top of the stairs. That could have been dangerous!
You open the door and see someone else! They're sat of a sofa, not moving a muscle.
Without thinking, you say "Someone else! What on EARTH happened here?!". 
Their face turns white as they see you, they reply "Shhhhh, oh no, oh no oh no, it's going to hear you!"
With that, a red eyed zombie bursts in through the door, ready for its dinner. The first thing it sees is the other student,
and it's more than happy with the menu.

What do you do?
