# **You hide behind a bench**

You spot a nearby bench and make your way to it. As you duck behind it, you hear... Nothing. They didn't see you!
You know you have to get somewhere safe, until something can be done about them. 
You scan your surroundings and see a few potential spots.

What do you do?
