You throw the lamp to the floor as hard as you possibly can.

It... EXPLODES 💥💥💥 into a cloud of red dust💨💨💨. Bats 🦇🦇🦇 fly out of the lamp in all directions as you scramble to collect yourself.

After inhaling said dust, you suddenly feel ill. It becomes harder to breathe.

You feel fatigue settling into your bones. A chill runs down your spin e and throughout your body. The tiny red man is nowhere to be found. 

He probably went to buy a new lamp or something... Ah well, that's no longer important. You fall to the ground and close your eyes.

You dream about spaghetti and meatballs. But then the meatballs turn into 🦇 BATS 🦇 and CHASE YOU DOWN! 🦇🦇🦇

You die of COVID-19.

THE END! 🎬
