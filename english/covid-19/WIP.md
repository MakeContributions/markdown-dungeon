## ğŸš§ This area of the dungeon is currently being worked upon. ğŸš§

Now you are trapped in a jail Darker than Darkness itself. The shread of red moonlight on only thing you watch for.

There Comes Noting but despair and agony To suddenly hearing a cat ğŸ™€ with mask on face and protective barrier around it glow like only hope of mankind or maybe only the remaining of mankind.

Watch What happes next another time.

If you have something to add here then you can help us by [contributing to this dungeon](https://github.com/MakeContributions/markdown-dungeon/issues/112) ğŸ™‚
