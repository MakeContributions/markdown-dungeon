You unroll the the piece of parchment and discover that it's a map!

The map details the different rooms of the dungeon, including the room you are in. Apparently, the dungeon was used to house a minotaur! A beast that is half-man, half-bull. He is located at the other side of the dungeon in what seems to be the biggest cell in the building.

You also notice what seems to be labeled as the exit on the other side of the dungeon, right next to the minotaur's holding cell. You gulp loudly in fear of what the beast might do when it does get its hands on you.

The room with the minotaur is just a few rooms across after going through the main hall, which comes after the corridor.

With this information, you head back to the corridor.
