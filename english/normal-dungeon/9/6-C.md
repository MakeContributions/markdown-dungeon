After careful consideration, you decide to explore the facility. Making use of your 🔦 torch to light the path, you make your way down the large corridor of the facility.

You take a look around at the 🏢 cells at the sides of the corridor. You do your best to make out the contents of each cell with the help of your torch, dimly lighting the interiors of each room.

Most of the cells were locked and most were also empty. Only three cells held something noteworthy and accessible, at least from what you can see with the help of your torch.

One cell contains two wooden chests 📦📦. Another room has a table with a few things. The last cell contains the remains of a man 💀.
