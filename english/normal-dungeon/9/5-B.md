You have found what appears to be a small, walk-in tool closet, most likely used by the previous inhabitants to store their house-keeping tools 🛠. You find large scythes ⛏ for cutting the grass, hoes, buckets, ropes, and shovels. 

Unfortunately, there's nothing you could potentially use for a fight. Best to leave everything as is 😕.
