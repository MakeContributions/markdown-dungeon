Stepping through the door 🚪⬅ on the left, you find yourself now in a large, extravagant dining hall, dust-covered chairs 🪑 lining the expansive dining table, cobwebs 🕸 covering their backs and arms. There's enough seats for over twenty people, but obviously dinner hasn't been served in quite some time.

You can see another door 🚪 on the other end of the hall to the right ➡, that you can only assume must lead to the kitchens.
