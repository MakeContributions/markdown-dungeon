Walking to the next room, you are startled by the sound of snarling. 

**Before you can react, a goblin 👺 leaps out at you!!!**

Lacking anything to defend yourself with, you desperately try to run 🏃🏻‍♂️ away from the goblin 👺, but it leaps and knocks you to the ground. It stabs you 🔪 in the back 🔙 as you try to swat it off, and its knife 🔪  next comes down upon your throat.

***THE END 💀***
