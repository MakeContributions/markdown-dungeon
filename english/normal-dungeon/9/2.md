Entering inside, you step into a rather **large main hall**, which has seen better days.

 Thick layers of dust cover the furniture 🛋 that, in its time, must have been rather extravagant, but now, it has lost its splendor. A large spiraling stairway leads upwards to the second floor, while there are two more doors 🚪🚪 to your left ⬅ and right ➡. You also notice a large door 🚪  ajar leading down to a dark cellar.
