Entering inside, you step into a rather large main hall, which has seen better days. Thick layers of dust cover the furniture that in its time must have been rather extravagant, but now has lost its splendor. A large spiraling stairway leads upwards to the second floor, while there are two more doors to your left and right. You also notice a large door ajar leading down to a dark cellar.
