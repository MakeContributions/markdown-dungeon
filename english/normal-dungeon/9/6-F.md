You enter the room with the human remains. You look at it. You feel sad. 

You think to yourself as to why you bothered walking into this room. I bet that guy lived a life of wonder and adventure, but unfortunately met his tragic end in this dungeon.

This revelation instills in you a new hope that maybe, just maybe, you'll make it out of here alive. You've already made it this far, what's stopping you?

You make your way back to the corridor.
