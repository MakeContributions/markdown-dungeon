Walking to the next room, you are startled by the sound of snarling. Before you can react, a goblin 👺 leaps out at you.

Quickly grabbing your sword ⚔️, you sidestep its leap and in one fall downward,you chop off its head ⚔. Good thing you took that sword!

Looking inside the room, you find what looks to be another dead adventurer 😐 ; judging by the state of the corpse ⚰️, he must have been dead for a couple of weeks now.
