You find yourself in a large hallway, with doors on the left and doors on the right. A large scenery painting hangs on the wall in front of you of a beautiful cliff, with mountains in the distance crowned by a crimson sunset. 
While there doesn't seem to be anything in the hallway of interest, there is one door on your left, and three doors on your right.
