You find yourself in a large hallway, with doors 🚪 on the left ⬅ and doors 🚪 on the right ➡.

 A large scenery painting 🖼 hangs on the wall 🧱 in front of you of a beautiful cliff 🧗🏻‍♂️, with mountains 🏔  in the distance crowned by a crimson sunset 🌇.

While there doesn't seem to be anything in the hallway of interest, there is one door 🚪 on your left ⬅, and three doors on your right.
