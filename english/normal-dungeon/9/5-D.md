You have entered into a large hallway, which leads down at least twenty feet to a large hallway, whose sides are lined with windows that show the outside.

 This hallway, which terminates with a single lone door 🚪, seems to lead to the back of the castle 🏰. The floor is lined with an ornate red carpet 🟥, and has long burnt-out torches lining the walls every five feet 🔥.
