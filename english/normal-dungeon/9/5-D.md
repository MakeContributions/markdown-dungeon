You have entered into a large hallway, which leads down at least twenty feet to a large hallway, whose sides are lined with windows that show the outside. This hallway, which terminates with a single lone door, seems to lead to the back of the castle. The floor is lined with an ornate red carpet, and has long burnt-out torches lining the walls every five feet.
