You approach the chest to your right. You investigate it with the help of your torch. You try to open it, but it's locked. 

You try to force the chest open, but it won't budge. It seems that whatever loot is inside the chest is going to have to keep waiting.

You feel a strange presence emanating from behind you, but when you turn around, it's just another chest. You feel like you're being watched, but you quickly dismiss the feeling as you head back to the corridor.
