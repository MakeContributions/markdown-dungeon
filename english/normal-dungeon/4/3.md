After days of searching, you are unable to find the secret mountain⛰️.

Overcome with desperation and hopelessness 😧, knowing the goblins 👺 have surely eaten your son 👦 by now, you are overcome by grief, and hang yourself off a branch from a nearby tree 🌳💀. Perhaps some help from a friend 🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♂️ would have prevented your demise 💘 ?
 
Hopefully you will see him again in the next world 🌎...

THE END🎬
