Luckily, they had a map 🗺️ to guide and help you find your son 👦🏻. The path leads you far away 🧭 from home 🏡 until ... you come across two bridges 🌉. Unfortunately, the map says nothing of this bridge 😕. 

Which way will you go? 🤔

- [Go to the left bridge ⬅️](3-B.md)
- [Go to the right bridge ➡️](3-C.md)
