Stepping thru the door on the left, you find yourself now in a large, extravagant dining hall, dust-covered chairs lining the expansive dining table, cobwebs covering their backs and arms. There's enough seats for over twenty people, but obviously dinner hasn't been served in quite some time.

You can see another door on the other end of the hall to the right, that you can only assume must lead to the kitchens.
