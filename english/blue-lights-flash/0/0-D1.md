As the spectrals chant around you, you begin to change.

You feel weightless, stronger, the world transforms with a blue glow.

Before long you are just like them but its strange.

You are overwhelmed with emotions but your mind begins to fade.

You can no longer think or move for yourself, you are a slave to the spectrals now.

What will happen for the rest of the night, what will you be involved in.
