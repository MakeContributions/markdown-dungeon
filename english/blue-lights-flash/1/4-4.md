As you stare your heart begins to race and the loud hum returns, this time louder and more painful.

You also begin to notice blue eyes emerging from the woods, multiple of them,

the same eyes you saw on this being.

The pain from the hum increases, you feel youself losing consciousness, as this happens you see these things break out into a sprint towards you.
