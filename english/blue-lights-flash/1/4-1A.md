As your eyes adjust to looking almost directly at the sun, you begin to spot plumes of smoke,

as if fires started all around the town but weirdly enough, you do not hear the sound of fire engines...

or any noise for that matter.

Regerdless, any noise you may have heard would have been drowned out by the hum which at this point has become unbrearable.
