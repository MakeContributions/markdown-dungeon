As you climb up the stairs you hear the hum getting louder and louder,

as you reach the top of the stairs the hum becomes unbearable, you feel youself losing consciousness.

You see a blue glow emanating from under the bathroom door,

the hum becomes so loud its painful but for some reason you are drawn to the door.
