You are Frodo Baggins, Ring bearer and part of the Fellowship of the Ring.  You are tasked with the quest of taking the one Ring of Power to Mount Doom in Mordor and, by throwing it in the fires of lava, destroying it.  This is the only way the Ring can be destroyed, and the only way that the Dark Lord Sauron can be undone and defeated.

You have journeyed with your fellows from Rivendell where the quest was laid on you by the elders.  Having travelled far, and denied an easier route over the mountains, you stand now before the gate to the Mines of Moria.

In the cliff wall, there is a silvery portal, illuminated by the moonlight.Elvish writing adorns it.

According to Gandalf the writing reads;

"The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.  Speak, friend, and enter."  *
