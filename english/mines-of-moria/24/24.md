# Gandalf stands at the center of the bridge


 The party runs across the bridge to the relative safety of the other side.

 As Gandalf stands defiantly in the center of the bridge, the Balrog appears.

 Cloaked in flame, eyes afire, and bearing a hideous flaming whip the Balrog is a demon of the underworld.  Huge wings open from it's shoulders as it screams out in challenge and cracks it's whip.

"You cannot pass!"

Silence, but the Balrog's flame dims and the darkness grows around it. It takes a step on the bridge.

"You cannot pass! I am a servent of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor.  You cannot pass.  The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun.  Go back to the Shadow!  You cannot pass!"

The Balrog steps further onto the bridge.
