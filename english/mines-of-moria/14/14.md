# **A loud noise**

 As you start walking towards the rotting wooden door, Merry, who is sitting next to an open well, accidentally knocks an old bucket attached to a rusty chain, which falls down the well, banging and making a terrible amount of noise....all....the...way...to....the.........................bottom......boom!

"You fool!" shouts Gandalf, "throw yourself in next time and rid us of your nonsense!"

Then far off in the distance, drums..... drums.... drums in the deep....

Everyone in the fellowship looks around anxiously.

What do you do?
