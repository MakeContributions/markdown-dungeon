# Gandalf stands at the center of the bridge


 The party runs across the bridge to the relative safety of the other side.

 As Gandalf stands defiantly in the center of the bridge, the Balrog appears.

 Cloaked in flame, eyes afire, and bearing a hideous flaming whip the Balrog is a demon of the underworld.  Huge wings open from it's shoulders as it screams out in challenge and cracks it's whip.
