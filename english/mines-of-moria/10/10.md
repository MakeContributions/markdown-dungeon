 - [Run screaming back out the entrance door](../begin-journey.md)
 - [Swing the sword wildly at the ghost, hoping to at least keep it from doing something to you](../11/11.md)
 - ["Pardon the intrusion, oh Ballin, son of Fundin, but I need your sword."](../12/12.md)
 - [Run at and crash through the rotten wooden door, sword in hand](../14/14.md)
 - [Apologize, and quickly put the sword back](../4/4.md)
