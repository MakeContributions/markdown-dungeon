**TING TONG! 6th FLOOR** 

After you and Ash reach the 6th floor
Both of you will be immediately attacked by those 2 guards.

>ASH : What made you attack us, you betrayed your honor to the Empire?

>GUARD1 : Do you really think the guards don't know each other?

>GUARD2 : The two of us may be just a little guard, but that's not an excuse for our incompetence.

After we were caught, they locked us in a more secure place and we were being watched every second.

You have failed to escape

You are dead ☠️.
